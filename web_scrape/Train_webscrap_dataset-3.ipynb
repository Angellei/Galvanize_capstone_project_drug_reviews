I didn&#039;t have to wait long, I went from having about six hot flashes a day, lasting about two to three minutes, to having three or four mini flashes. I was incredibly grateful, was able to sleep through the night as well. Just recently, they started to become unbearable again, so they increased the dosage. Really does work.

My psychiatrist slowly increased the dosage to 150 mg over the past few months. During that time, with the addition of psychotherapy, I began to slowly recognize that my symptoms were decreasing. It has become much easier to recognize my intrusive thoughts as OCD, and to say &quot;no&quot; to the multitude of rituals that I engaged in on a daily basis.
