# Sentiment and Side effect Analysis of prescriptional drug reviews
## Motivation
- This is the first business project hold by Good Grug Medical, a startup data analysis company.  The dataset used in this project provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites  (Druglib.com). 
- Sentiment Analysis of these reviews could be useful for pharmacy companies and doctors to quickly get into bad reviews and know patients' complains. Also, a lot of symptoms and drug sides were hiden under reviews, which will be great to be automatically extracted to improve the drug and help to give a better prescription. 
- We try to utilize this dataset to do data mining for patient behavior and drug effectiveness in order to provide useful information to patients, doctors and pharmacy companies.

## Target
- Find diseases with significantly seasonal variations based on dates of posting comments.  
- Train the model to predict sentiment of reviews as "Positive", "Negative", and "Neutral" based on vectorized words from patients’ comments.
- Explore side effects from patients’ comments.

## Learning methods for classification
      1. Logistic regresssion
      2. SVM 
      3. Random forest 
      4. Gradient boosting
      5. LSTM
- **What's LSTM?**
  Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture (XX et al) used in the field of deep         learning. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an **input gate**, an **output gate** and a **forget gate**. The cell remembers     values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. Comparing to         classical RNN, LSTM is capable of handling "long-term dependencies" **VERY WELL**.

## Exploratory data analysis
- The number of comments posted had a trend of increasing with time seires. The website probably became more popular after 2015.

- The number of comments for each condition/disease was unbalanced. We had a extremely high number of comments for birth control.

### Find conditions/diseases with significantly seasonal variations
- The figour below showed the percentage of comments for the top 50 conditions with the most comments among 12 months. Several of them obviously presented some preference on distinct months, such as weight Loss and cough.

</p>

- Chi-squared test was used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequency and the observed frequencies. The expected frequency here was assumed to be the frequency of all conditions/diseases among 12 months and the observed frequency of each condition was then compared to it. The resulting p-value was adjusted using fdr correction.<br/>
<br/>H0: The frequency of the condition/disease in 12 months have no difference with that the expected frequency.
<br/>H1: The frequency of the condition/disease in 12 months have difference with that the expected frequency. <br/>
<br/> Top 10 conditions with lowest adjusted p-values

   |Condition|Statistic|p-value|adjusted p-value|
   |---|---|---|---|

## Modeling for sentiment analysis of drug reviews
- The 215,063 patients' comments were provided together with rating ranging from 0 to 10. Here, I assigned the rating into three categories "Positive" (<= 4), "Negative" (>=7), and "Neutral" (>4 and <7) in order to avoild bias from personal influence. The words in comments were cleaned, stemmized and vectorized using tf-idf. 
- The dataset was then trained using Logistic regresssion, SVM, Random forest and Gradient boosting as well as embeding plus LSTM. The resulting confusion matrixes were listed below.
- The dataset is huge and modeling could be computationally expensive. So Amazon Web Services (AWS) was appied to achieve a more efficient processing (m5.4xlarge).

   |model|Random forest|LSTM|Logistic regresssion|SVM linear kernel|Gradient boosting|Baseline(choose the most frequent class)|
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |Accuracy|0.88|0.83|0.78|0.78|0.74|0.65|

Intresetingly, Random forest gave a the highest accuracy (0.88) comparing to all other algorithms, even LSTM. Even more impressive, it gave a 99% accuracy rate on positive sentiment. LSTM is capable of remembering information for long periods of time, but it only achieved a higher accuracy rate on positive sentiment rather than rest of two. The indpendant words probably contained enough imformation for a good classifier. However, if keeping do more tuning for LSTM, it's still very likely to get a model with higher performance but very computationally expensive. Hence, I chose Random forest as the final model. Generally speaking, all the models here didn't performaned very well on neutral sentiment, but Random forest still achieved a 60% accuracy rate. 

<br/>

- I didn't use default feature importance generated by scikit-learn Random forest package to present contributions of words to the classifier since it tends to inflate the importance of continuous or high-cardinality categorical variables (2007 Strobl et). Instead, permutation importance was applied, which measures the importance of a feature as follows. It permutes the column values of a single predictor feature and then pass all test samples back through the Random Forest and recompute the accuracy. The importance of that feature is the difference between the baseline and the drop in overall accuracy caused by permuting the column.

<br/>

- However, the permutation importance above didn't really seperate contributions of words for sentiments of “Positive”, “Negative” and “Neutral”, respectively. So I also put the figures of wordcloud showing coefficients of the logistic regression model, which might give us some ideas about which words could be good indicators for both "Positive" and "Negative".

## Modeling for identification of comments with side effects
- It will also be very suggestive to drug pharmacy companies if I can build a model to filtering comments and quickly selecting patients' complains about side effects. However, the dataset used above didn't really contained the label of "with/without side effects". So web scraping is applied to extract comments and this type of labe from druglib.com, leading to total 4160 records.

- tf-idf vecterization with Logistic regresssion, SVM, Random forest and Gradient boosting as well as embeding plus LSTM were applied to train data. LSTM here gave a highest performance about 84.3% accuracy, 9% higher than the seconde one, SVM with linear kernel (75.4%).



|   ROC curve             |  Model   | Accuracy | ROC-AUC|
|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|-------------------------:|
|![](Plot/ROC_curve.png)  |  Logistic regresssion<br />SVM linear<br />SVM rbf<br />Random forest <br /> Gradient boosting<br /> LSTM|0.73<br />0.75<br />0.68<br />0.71<br />0.72 <br />0.86|0.78 <br /> - <br /> - <br /> 0.79 <br /> 0.77 <br /> 0.84|

- Despite of the best performance, the model trained using LSTM is always hard to interpret. So we also looked into the second best model built by SVM using linear kernel. The figure below showed words with the top highest and lowest coefficients in the linear SVM model, which contributed to maximizing the margin and determining the boundary of two classes.

Top words in the linear SVM appeared to be related to description of some discomfort (e.g. "nausea", "dry", "diarrhea", "heartburn") dizzi"). However, these words could be ambiguous and included both symptoms and side effects, probably disturbing classification and resulting in a relatively lower performance. LSTM, as a special kind of RNN, is able to maintain some "memories" for forward/backworad words and likely to better "understand" the whole sentence. 
<br />

- Comments of benefits, side effects and others were separated in this data set, which could be distinct to usual comments online. Despite three types of comments were incorporated for training, I still believe it should be neccesary to use the models to predit the other dataset with no label of side effects (used in the last section) in order to test the models in the real world. 

   The accuracies were estimated by artificial reading 10 randomly sample records. Obviously, the LSTM model helped to identity more ture negative (no side effects) than random selection despite of similar performance on true postive. If adding more comments with labled of side effects in the future, it is very possible to achieve a better model.
