# Sentiment Analysis of prescription drugy reviews and key words of side effects extraction
## Motivation
- This is the first business project hold by Good Grug Medical, a startup data analysis company.  The dataset used in this project provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites  (Druglib.com). 
- Sentiment Analysis of these reviews could be useful for pharmacy companies and doctors to quickly get into bad reviews and know patients' complains. Also, a lot of symptoms and drug sides were hiden under reviews, which will be great to be automatically extracted to improve the drug and help to give a better prescription. 
- We try to utilize this dataset to do data mining for patient behavior and drug effectiveness in order to provide useful information to patients, doctors and pharmacy companies.

## Target
- Find diseases with significantly seasonal variations based on dates of posting comments.  
- Train the model to predict sentiment of reviews as “Positive”, “Negative”, and “Neutral” based on vectorized words from patients’ comments.
- Explore side effects from patients’ comments.

## EDA
